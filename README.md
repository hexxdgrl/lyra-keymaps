# My Keyboards
## I am currently using: CRKBD Corne Rev 3 Cherry
![alt text](https://github.com/keymaps/img/cornelayout.)
This keymap is based on the [Miryoku Layout](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) and [Arno's Engram V2 Layout](https://engram.dev/).



This is my personal folder of qmk firmware for my keyboards, none of the default files do I claim to be mine, all the original authors are mentioned in their respective files, if applicable.
